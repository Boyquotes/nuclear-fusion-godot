You get to the building (where the bomb is), you find the bomb, you get out your pliers, you cut the wrong wire!!! It blows up. Your master is taking an evening strole and he finds you dead buy your brain isn't damaged. He says "I'm going to turn him into a cyborg, he can kill the enemy later, but I have to be careful not to damage his brain... too much.". It might hurt to be stuck inside metal the whole time.
